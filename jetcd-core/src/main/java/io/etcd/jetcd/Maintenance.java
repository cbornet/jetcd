/**
 * Interface of maintenance talking to etcd.
 *
 * <p>
 * An etcd cluster needs periodic maintenance to remain reliable. Depending
 * on an etcd application's needs, this maintenance can usually be
 * automated and performed without downtime or significantly degraded
 * performance.
 *
 * <p>
 * All etcd maintenance manages storage resources consumed by the etcd
 * keyspace. Failure to adequately control the keyspace size is guarded by
 * storage space quotas; if an etcd member runs low on space, a quota will
 * trigger cluster-wide alarms which will put the system into a
 * limited-operation maintenance mode. To avoid running out of space for
 * writes to the keyspace, the etcd keyspace history must be compacted.
 * Storage space itself may be reclaimed by defragmenting etcd members.
 * Finally, periodic snapshot backups of etcd member state makes it possible
 * to recover any unintended logical data loss or corruption caused by
 * operational error.
